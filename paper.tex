% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX

% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

% Allow "Thomas van Noord" and "Simon de Laguarde" and alike to be sorted by "N" and "L" etc. in the bibliography.
% Write the name in the bibliography as "\VAN{Noord}{Van}{van} Noord, Thomas"

% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
The abstract should briefly describe the aims, methods, and main results of the paper.
It should be a single paragraph not more than 250 words (200 words for Letters).
No references should appear in the abstract.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}
- Talk about the low frequency radio population

- Why is classification needed

- previous efforts -- spectra based, phot based -- 

- this paper -  so talk again about desi and lotss


\section{Data}

\begin{figure}

    \caption{(Left panel) 150 MHz radio luminosity coverage of the radio-detected and the $z < 1$ SWIRE-selected source samples used in this work. (Right panel) Histogram showing the number count of sources binned by 150 MHz luminosity for the two data samples. Sources with radio luminosity less than $10^{16}~\mathrm{WHz}^{-1}$ were arbitrarily assigned to the lowest radio luminosity bin.}
    % The inclusion of the radio non-detected sources is often crucial in analyses and provide significant analytical power.  
    \label{fig:filters_jwst_hst}
\end{figure}

\subsection{LoTSS photometry}
ELAIS N1 again...
Describe the filters -- that is sort of there, 

\subsection{DESI Spectra}
Wavelength coverage  - $0.6-5\mu\mathrm{m}$. Three spectral resolutions  - 100, 1000, 2700.

\subsection{Sample selection}
spectra

sample - cuts and all

plot idea - ra dec coverage?? can also add sdss to show how better desi is? Can also include weave to show how better it will be?

\section{Prospector}
\subsection{Model setup}
Do we want to use continuity or bursty? Bursty may be better as it allows a greater degree of freedom.

Do we want to keep c3k library on? What about metallicities? 

\subsection{Parameter estimates}

\section{Results}

\section{Conclusions}

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe
the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

The Acknowledgements section is not numbered. Here you can thank helpful
colleagues, acknowledge funding agencies, telescopes and facilities used etc.
Try to keep it short.

\section*{Data Availability}

 
The inclusion of a Data Availability Statement is a requirement for articles published in MNRAS. Data Availability Statements provide a standardised format for readers to understand the availability of data underlying the research results described in the article. The statement may refer to original data generated in the course of the study or to third-party data analysed in the article. The statement should describe and provide means of access, where possible, by linking to the data or providing the required accession numbers for the relevant databases or DOIs.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% REFERENCES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The best way to enter references is to use BibTeX:

\bibliographystyle{mnras}
\bibliography{bibfile} % if your bibtex file is called example.bib
